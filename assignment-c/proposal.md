SHAPEXPLOSION

## 2.	Description of proposed project
I have decided to make use of the embedded iteration technique to create shapes that will be manipulated by audio signal. The iteration technique can help further explore simple shapes as the effects multiply and layer over one another when they are repeated. In addition to the iteration technique, Iâ€™ll also use the fractal technique to multiply the shape. The purpose of my project is to help enhance the listening experience of the audience with the reactive visuals by sending them through a journey of series of colours and trippy shapes. These 2 techniques are most commonly used in the visuals of EDM DJs as the seamless loops are simple to digest and are also accompanied by laser light shows.

## 3.	Methodology
In the entire 2 minute video, the visual will start out as a wave bed and bounces to the music.

When the build up comes in there will be a main shape in the center in neon colour. Bright and neon colours will be used for this visual against a black background so it looks very sci-fi.

During the build up of the song, the shape will pop out and enlarge in time with the rate of the kick from the track. When the song reaches the drop, the shapes will split and duplicate into fractals. I plan to use the kaleidoscope and flickering effect evenly throughout the project. The visual is focused on being geometric with the shapes and reacts to the audio signals received. Since it is an energetic EDM music, the visual will be very fast and responsive to the live performance.

After the drop of the song, I could go into an iteration of shapes while the song slowly fades off.

The visual may also end up in a trial of melted colours and continue to move according to the beat of the song. The lower the frequency the brighter the colour will be, and the more vigorous it will move. All in all, it is to create an explosions of shapes that will throw the audience off and make it hard for them to have one main focus on the screen.

## 5.	Sound track details

The song will be a bass heavy aggressive dubstep track at a tempo of about 150bpm lasting for about 2 minutes.

For the intro of my project, I am influenced by one of the sketch from Generative Designs. This work creates a terrain like mesh based on the noise values controlled by the mouse. During my live performance, I can incorporate this into my project to control the waves and add in more ripples as the song progresses.

Another reference for my project would be the sketch from Generative Designs that packs as many circles as possible over the time. This can be used when my track transits from the drop to the breakdown whereby the circles slowly cool off and goes back to 1 main shape.

[Derez Creep It Real/EDM Night at Club 301 visual set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYI60rNRW4o)

In this 1 hour long visual set, Derez used a series of technique from noise, glitch to iteration and fractals, but mainly with shape manipulation. The example is very similar to what I am planning to do as he utilises bright colours and simple shapes intensified into complex patterns.
